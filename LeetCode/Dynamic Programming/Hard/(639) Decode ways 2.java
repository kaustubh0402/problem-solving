/*
Decode array | Explanation:
We have to make two calls
for i-1 and i-2 (as letters have maximum mapping upto 2 digits)
We have to check various condition before calling function
1. for i-1 call (single character)
   char should not be 0 as it is given that no mapping for 0
2. for i-2 call (double character)
   character should be in range "10" and "26"
   as prefix 0 is not allowed
   
One extra condition added :
'*' symbol is added and it can be any number from 1 to 9
Now again we have to check conditions

for i-1 call (single character)
 1. Normal call as above mentioned in decode-ways-i
 2. if char i-1 is '*' then we have nine posibilities so we will multiply curr call by 9
 
for i-2 call (doubel character)
 1. Normal call as above mentioned in decode-ways-i
 2. if char at i-2 is '*'
      1) if (i-1) is less than 7 (then multiply by 2) why?? as i-2 can be '1' or '2' 
	  2) if(i-1) is greater than 7 then (multiply by 1) as i-2 only have '1' as possibility 
	     we cannot put i-2 as '2' in place of * as it will generate 27,28,29 which are not following condition
	  3) if (i-1) is also *
	     in above cases both are * so there are total 15 posibilities 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24,25,26
		 basically we are including all from 1 to 26 except whose digit contains 0 (as mentioned * cannot be 0)
 3. if char at i-1 is *
      1) if (i-1) is 1 then * can be 9 (1 to 9) any digits
	  2) if (i-1) is 2 then * can be less than 7 (1-6) as we can choose from (21-26) total 6
