/*
Explanation:
From operation 1 We can conclude that if we have same frequency of each character then we will return true;
  As swap opeartion will transform any word to other word of same frequency of each letter
To achieve operation 1 we will use operation 2:
  Two condition for operation 2
  1) if character is present in word1 then it must be in word2 and vice versa
  2) operation 2 allows to swap frequency in general
     so we need equal amount of frequencies irrespective of letters
	 i.e if word1 has frequencies a=3 and b=2
	 and word2 has frequencies a=2 and b=3 then we can swap both
	 In general we have to ensure that frequencies of letter in both words should be same
