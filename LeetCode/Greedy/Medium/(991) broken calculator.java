//Problem no : 991

/*
Explanation:
Wrong thinking:
 start from X and we will multiply x by 2 each time till X<y 
 add X-Y stpes to above steps as answer
 above method fails
 consider 3 10
 By above method:
 X=6   step=1
 X=12  step=2;
 X-Y=12-10=2  total steps=steps+(X-Y)=2+2=4
 which is wrong 
 correct answer is  X=6 X=5 and X=10 steps=3

Why above methods fail??
  Our Aim is to convert X to Y 
  i.e. Y should final answer
  so we have to start from end i.e Y
