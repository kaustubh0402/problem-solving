/*
This is the logic the code is using-
If there are count zeroes in between two 1s, then how many 1s can we place in those zeroes without violating the given condition? Answer is (count-1)/2. The only cases this doesn't apply are when there are zeroes(1 or more)

At the beginning of the array.
At the end of the array.
For these 2 cases, the number of 1s that we can place is count/2. But to generalize the algorithm and to simplify code inside loop, count has been initialized to 1 for the first time and result += (count-1)/2 effectively becomes result += count/2 for the case 1. For case 2, result is updated outside the loop, again by count/2 times.

Finally, we check if the number of possible 1s that we can place is greater than or equal to n. If so, we return true else false.

IMPORTANT
set count = 1 to solve the problem that the beginning of flowerbed is 0
