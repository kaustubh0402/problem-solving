//problem no : 191

/*
Explanation (Total 3 methoda)
1.  Simple just check whether each bit is set or not using  loop (num>>1)&1
2.   Below method by checking only set bits using n&(n-1) it will unset all bits from LSB
3.   Using look up table (Important for many queries or numbers in one go)
Refer gfg notes
