//Problem no : 231

/*
Explanation:
Here n&(n-1) will unset rightmost bit of n to 0
for power of 2 we will required only 1 set bit in n
so after performing n&(n-1) we should get 0 as answer if n is power of 2 
as only 1 bit will n and that will unset because above operation
*/

/*
Here we can also use hashset 
store all powers of 2 in hashset (31 integers total)
and check whether number is present in hashset or not
*/
