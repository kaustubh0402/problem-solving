//Problem no : 1404

/*
Explanation:
First we have to consider extra 0 at MSB as it may possible that it will used when case '111'
We have to perform 2 operation:
if odd then LSB will always 1
so we have to add 1
Result after adding 1 will be all bits from LSB to till we find 0 will be 0 and first 0 from LSB will be 1 (Step++) (Do not decrement index as it will not reduce bit)
Now for  even we have to just remove LSB (i.e steps++ and index--)
