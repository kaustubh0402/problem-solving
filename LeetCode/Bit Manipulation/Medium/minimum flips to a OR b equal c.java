//problem no: 1318

/*
Explanation:
1) find OR of a,b let say orvalue=a|b;
2)Now we Have to compare result of orvalue with given c
3)Iterate for 32 times(32 bit int in java)
4)There are two case if mismatch is found 
  1.if in given c bit is 1 and orvalue has bit 0
    for above case we need to change bit of orvalue to 1
	we don't care about which number among a,b to set 1 
	but we know that if bit of either one bit is set 1 then orvalue bit will be 1
	basically we have to change bit of one number only (OR logic property)
	then ans will be increment by 1
  2.if given c bit is 0 and orvalue has bit 1
    In above there are two possibilities
	  a)If bit of both a and b are set so we have to unset both bits to change orvalue to 0
	    so we will increase ans by 2
	  b)If bit of either bit is set so we have to change only one bit(among a,b) to 0 
	    as other number bit is already 0 
		so we will increase ans by 1.
5)if mismatch not found do nothing.
