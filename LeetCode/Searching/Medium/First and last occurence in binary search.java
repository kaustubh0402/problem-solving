/*
We will use Binary search for optimal
first we will find first occurence and then second occurence'
we can also use this tecnique for calculating number of times given occuring number in sorted array
Explanation of modified binary search in comments

/*
Brute force O(n)
Traverse through array till we find first occurence mark thaty number
again cintinue till we find greater than target in array and mark that second occurence
