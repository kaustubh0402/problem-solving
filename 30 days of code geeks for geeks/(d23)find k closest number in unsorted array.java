/*
Lucy lives in house number X. She has a list of N house numbers in the society. 
Distance between houses can be determined by studying the difference between house numbers.
 Help her find out K closest neighbors.
Note: If two houses are equidistant and Lucy has to pick only one, 
the house with the smaller house number is given preference.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, X = 0, K = 4
a[] = {-21, 21, 4, -12, 20}, 
Output:
-21 -12 4 20
Explanation:
The closest neighbour is house
number 4. Followed by -12 and 20. -21 and 21 
are both equal distance from X=0. Therefore, 
Lucy can only pick 1. Based on the given 
condition she picks -21 as it is the smaller 
of the two.
