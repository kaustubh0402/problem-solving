/*
Geek wants to make a special space for candies on his bookshelf. 
Currently, it has N books of different heights and unit width. 
Help him select 2 books such that he can store maximum candies between them by 
removing all the other books from between the selected books. 
The task is to find out the area between 2 books that can hold 
the maximum candies without changing the original position of selected books. 

Input: N = 6, height[] = {2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5}
Output: 8
Explanation: We remove the 4 books in the middle 
creating length = 4 for the candy dam. Height 
for dam will be min(2,5) = 2. Area between book 
of height 2 and book of height 5 is 2 x 4 = 8.
